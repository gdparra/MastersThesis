"Cognitive Interference Avoidance 4th Generation GPS with Unjammable
 Radio Links"

The following work proposes a terrestrial positioning system with
anti-jamming capabilities that can locate a target with a 1 cm error
margin in a 40 square miles area under a SNR/SNIR of 15dB. This is
achieved by utilizing OFDM to transmit Zadoff-Chu sequences to a target
for delay estimation. Additionally, a novel Interference Avoidance
Algorithm is proposed which autonomously avoids interference signals
and optimally allocates power across the frequency spectrum.

An additional conference paper, presented at IEEE 2015 SoSE, was
inspired on this work which can be found as:
